            offering memoranda (OMs), appraisals, and other deal-related materials ("User Content"). You represent and

        </p>
        <p>
            You hereby grant ZSR a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to copy, store, process, analyze, and
            otherwise use your User Content solely in connection with the operation of the Service, including to generate
            underwriting reports and improve the Service. You assume all risk associated with your User Content and have
            sole responsibility for its accuracy, quality, legality, and appropriateness.
        </p>
        <p>
            You authorize ZSR to collect and analyze User Content and other data relating to the Service to derive
            statistical and usage data. ZSR may use such aggregated, de-identified data for any purpose in accordance
            with applicable law and our Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        @* --- Section 4: AI Technology & Output Accuracy --- *@
        <h2>4. AI Technology &amp; Output Accuracy</h2>
        <p>
            The Service includes proprietary and third-party advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence,
            machine learning systems, third-party large language models, and similar technology and features (together,
            "AI Technology"). Due to the nature of AI Technology, information, content, recommendations, or data generated
            by such AI Technology ("Output") may be incorrect or inaccurate. Service features that include AI Technology
            are not a substitute for human oversight. When you use the Service you understand and agree:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Output received from the Service may contain errors or misleading information and may not always be
                accurate or reliable. You should not rely on information from our Service as a sole source of truth or
                factual information, or as a substitute for professional advice.
            </li>
            <li>
                You must evaluate Output for accuracy and appropriateness for your use case, including using human review
                as appropriate, before using or relying on such information.
            </li>
            <li>
                AI Technology can perpetuate biases that are present in the data used to train them, and the Service may
                provide incomplete, incorrect, or offensive Output that does not represent our views.
            </li>
            <li>
                If Output references any third-party products or services, it does not mean the third party endorses or
                is affiliated with us.
            </li>
            <li>
                ZSR bears no liability to you or anyone else arising from or relating to your use of AI Technology or
                reliance on any Output.
