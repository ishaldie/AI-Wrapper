        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
            Underwriting Analyst is an AI-powered platform that automates multifamily real estate acquisition underwriting.
            We help real estate professionals evaluate deals faster and with greater consistency by combining document
            intelligence with financial analysis.
        </p>

        <h3>Document Parsing</h3>
        <p>
            Upload your deal documents — rent rolls, trailing 12-month operating statements (T12s), loan term sheets,
            and offering memoranda — and our system extracts the key data points automatically, eliminating hours of
            manual data entry.
        </p>

        <h3>AI-Generated Underwriting Reports</h3>
        <p>
            Each analysis produces a comprehensive 10-section underwriting report covering net operating income (NOI),
            internal rate of return (IRR), debt service coverage ratio (DSCR), cap rates, risk assessment, and a
            GO/NO GO investment recommendation. Reports are generated in minutes, not days.
        </p>

        <h3>Deal Pipeline</h3>
        <p>
            Track and compare opportunities across your pipeline. Organize deals by status, revisit past analyses,
            and keep your team aligned on active opportunities.
        </p>

        <h3>Quick Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Need a rapid initial screening? Enter a property address and purchase price to get a high-level assessment
            before committing to a full underwrite.

        @* --- Section 2: How We Protect Your Data --- *@
        <h2>How We Protect Your Data</h2>
        <p>
            We take data security seriously. Here is how we protect your information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Authentication:</strong> Sign in with email and password or through Google and Microsoft OAuth.
                All passwords are cryptographically hashed — we never store them in plain text.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Encryption in transit:</strong> All data sent between your browser and our servers is encrypted
                via HTTPS/TLS.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No data sales:</strong> We do not sell your data to third parties. Your deal documents and
                analysis results are yours.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>AI provider data handling:</strong> Our AI provider (Anthropic) does not use data submitted
                through their API to train models. Your documents and deal information are not used to improve
                third-party AI systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Terms of Service enforcement:</strong> All users must accept our Terms of Service before
                accessing the platform, ensuring everyone understands how the service operates.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Upload restrictions:</strong> File uploads are restricted by type and size to prevent abuse
                and protect system integrity.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
