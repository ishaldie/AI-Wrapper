## Guide Structure

The guide is organized into 5 parts:
- **Part I** — Mortgage Loan (borrower/principal requirements, loan terms)
- **Part II** — Property (eligibility, valuation, income, inspections, reserves, insurance, environmental)
- **Part III** — Products & Features (property-type-specific underwriting)
- **Part IV** — Committing & Delivery (pricing tiers, fees, purchase, conversion)
- **Part V** — Servicing & Asset Management

**Key Document:** Form 4660 (Multifamily Underwriting Standards) — defines tier-based DSCR minimums, LTV maximums, interest-only rules, and underwriting floors for ALL mortgage loans.

## Universal Underwriting Standards (All Deal Types)

### Core Metrics (Conventional Baseline)
| Metric | Standard | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Min DSCR** | 1.25x | Net Cash Flow / Debt Service (varies by asset class) |
| **Max LTV** | 80% | Loan / Underwriting Value (varies by asset class) |
| **Amortization** | Up to 30 years (standard) | Up to 35 years for MAH |
| **Loan Terms** | 5–30 years | Varies by product |
| **Rate** | Fixed and variable options | SARM = variable with conversion option |
| **Recourse** | Non-recourse | Standard "bad boy" carve-outs (fraud, bankruptcy) |
| **Assumability** | Typically assumable | Subject to new borrower review (except Co-ops) |
| **Rate Lock** | 30–180 day commitments | Streamlined Rate Lock (SRL) option available |
| **Accrual** | 30/360 and Actual/360 | Varies by product |
| **Stabilization** | 90% occupancy for 90 days | Required prior to funding (conventional) |

### Underwritten NCF (Net Cash Flow) Components
1. Potential Gross Income (PGI)
2. Less: Vacancy & Collection Loss
3. Plus: Other Income (laundry, parking, fees)
4. = Effective Gross Income (EGI)
5. Less: Operating Expenses
6. Less: Replacement Reserves
7. = **Underwritten NCF**

### Required Documentation (All Types)
- Appraisal (independent appraiser selection)
- Property Condition Assessment (PCA)
- Environmental Site Assessment (Phase I, Phase II if triggered)
- Lease Audit
- Market Analysis / Market Study
- Borrower Financial Statements
- Guarantor Financial Documentation
- Title Insurance & Survey
- Property & Liability Insurance verification

### Underwriting Tiers (Form 4660)
Tiers 1–4 determine pricing and pre-review requirements. Each tier maps to specific DSCR/LTV combinations. Higher-risk profiles require higher DSCR and lower LTV.

## Refinance Risk Analysis — Base Assumptions
Section 204.01 requires specific base assumptions for:
- Income growth rates
- Expense growth rates
- Vacancy factor
- Cap rate at maturity
- Interest rate at maturity (refinance scenario)

These assumptions drive the refinance risk stress test to ensure the property can sustain debt at maturity.

## Implications for ZSR Underwriting App

### Current State
The app currently has:
- `ExecutionType` enum: `All`, `FannieMae`, `FreddieMac`
- Checklist seed data with Fannie-specific items (17 sections, 97+ items)
- Basic DSCR, LTV, cap rate calculations

### Gaps to Address
1. **Deal-type-specific underwriting profiles** — different DSCR/LTV/amortization by property type
2. **Seniors Housing NCF** — Skilled Nursing 20% cap test
3. **MAH-specific** — LIHTC analysis, HAP review, subordinate financing, 35yr amort
4. **Student Housing** — per-bed analysis, enrollment risk, 75% LTV cap
5. **Green Rewards** — energy savings in NCF, additional proceeds calculation
6. **Supplemental** — combined loan testing (New Loan Test)
7. **ARM/SARM** — interest rate stress testing at max rate
8. **Cooperative** — market rental basis NCF conversion
9. **MH Community Score** — manufactured housing scoring system
10. **Form 4660 tier classification** — map each deal to proper tier for pricing
11. **Refinance risk analysis** — maturity stress test with base assumptions
12. **Streamlined underwriting flags** — reduced documentation for qualifying deals
