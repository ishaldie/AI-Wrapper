# Conductor Status

Show current project and track status.

**FIRST: Read all context files before doing anything else.**

Read these files NOW:
- conductor/product.md
- conductor/tracks.md
- All conductor/tracks/*/metadata.json
- All conductor/tracks/*/plan.md

Also check for recent manual changes:
- Read conductor/notes/.changelog.json if it exists
- Shows recent file edits made through the Notepad UI
- Display as "Recent Manual Changes" section if present

---

## After Reading Context

### Calculate Metrics

For each track, count:
- Pending tasks: `[ ]`
- In-progress tasks: `[~]`
- Completed tasks: `[x]`

### Display Format

```
📊 Conductor Status

Project: <project-name>
Tracks: <total> | Tasks: <completed>/<total>

━━━ In Progress ━━━
🔵 <track-id> (<type>)
   ████████░░░░░░░░ 50% (4/8 tasks)
   Current: <current-task-name>

━━━ Planned ━━━
⚪ <track-id> (<type>)
   0% (0/6 tasks)

━━━ Completed ━━━
✅ <track-id> (<type>)
   Completed: <date>

━━━ Next Actions ━━━
→ Continue: /project:conductor:implement
→ New track: /project:conductor:newTrack "description"
```

### Edge Cases

- No tracks: Suggest creating one
- Not initialized: Suggest running setup

## Critical Rules

1. Always read conductor/ context files FIRST
2. Follow workflow.md EXACTLY as written
3. Get user approval before making changes
