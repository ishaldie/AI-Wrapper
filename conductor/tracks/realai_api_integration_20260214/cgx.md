# CGX: RealAI API Integration

## Frustrations & Friction
- [2026-02-15] A hook/linter auto-manages csproj Compile Remove entries and deletes test files placed in Infrastructure/ for "unimplemented" tracks. Workaround: place track tests in dedicated `RealAi/` subdirectory under tests.
- [2026-02-15] Pre-existing `RealAiTypes.cs` in Domain/ValueObjects conflicted with new per-type files — had to delete the combined file.
- [2026-02-15] Dual conductor directories (App/conductor/ and AI Wrappers/conductor/) — must update both.

## Good Patterns
- [2026-02-15] Implementing tightly coupled tasks (client + polly + DI + tests) in a single batch works well — avoids hook interference between steps.
- [2026-02-15] MockHttpMessageHandler as a simple test helper avoids needing Moq dependency.
- [2026-02-15] Commit only track-specific files to avoid conflicts with parallel agents.
- [2026-02-15] FakeRealAiClient with controllable responses is cleaner than mocking for cache service tests.
- [2026-02-15] Consolidating repetitive try/catch patterns into a generic FetchAsync<T> helper reduces duplication.

## Anti-Patterns
- [2026-02-15] Don't delete files generated by other agents — stub missing types instead.
